# How can we create new categorical variables? 

---

# ifelse()
----
ifelse() is a vectorised function with `test`, `yes`, and `no` vectors that will be applied to whatever you pass to it.

```{r ifelse1, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ifelse(test = vector == condition, "result if true", "result if false")
```
---
# ifelse()
----
```{r ifelse2, echo = TRUE}
x <- 1:6
ifelse(test = x < 3, yes = "small", no = "large")
```

```{r ifelse3, echo = TRUE}
nhanes %>% 
  mutate(pulse_type = ifelse(Pulse > 70, "fast", "slow")) %>% 
  select(Pulse, pulse_type)
```

---

# case_when() `r I(hexes(c("dplyr")))`
----
This function allows you to vectorize (and replace) multiple `if_else()` statements in a succinct and clear manner. The syntax is
```{r casewhen1, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
case_when(conditon1 ~ "result if conditon1 is true",
          condition2 ~ "results if condition2 is true",
          TRUE ~ "catch for everything else")
```


+ The Left hand side (LHS) determines which variables match a given case - this must return a logical vector
+ The Right hand side (RHS) provides the new or replacement value and all have to be of the same type of vector
+ you always end with a case of TRUE for when all of the other cases are FALSE
+ case_when is particularly useful inside mutate when you want to create a *new variable* that relies on a **complex combination** of existing variables
  
---
# case_when()`r I(hexes(c("dplyr")))`
----

```{r casewhen2, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
x <- 1:16
x
case_when(
  x < 5 ~ "< 5",
  x < 10 ~ "< 10",
  TRUE ~ as.character(x)
)
```

---
# case_when()`r I(hexes(c("dplyr")))`
----
```{r casewhen3, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
nhanes %>% 
  mutate(health_status = case_when(Diabetes == "Yes" ~ "at-risk",
                                   Age > 70 ~ "at-risk",
                                   BPDiaAve < 80 & BPSysAve > 120 ~ "at-risk",
                                   TRUE ~ "okay")) %>% 
  select(health_status) %>% head()

### Let's practice using case_when()
----
Look up the variable `AgeDecade` in the NHANES documentation (`?NHANES`). It is missing in our raw version of the dataset. Recreate `AgeDecade` using `case_when()` and find how many cases are in each age category.

## How to deal with text

---

# Strings
----
Strings (character vectors) are interesting. 

```{r string1, echo = TRUE}
a <- "Grace Hopper said, \"If it's a good idea, go ahead and do it.\nIt's much easier to apologize than it is to get permission.\""
a
cat(a)
```
-   `"\n"` represents a new line
-   `"\t"` represents a tab


---
# stringr `r I(hexes(c("stringr")))`
----
use `str_length()` to get the number of characters in a
string.

```{r string_length1, echo = TRUE}
beyonce <- "I am Beyoncé, always."
str_length(beyonce)
```

What about spaces and punctuation marks - they count! What about escaped
characters? The '' does not but the character itself does.

```{r string_length2, echo = TRUE}
str_length("I am Beyoncé, \nalways.")
```


---
## replacing words with `str_replace()` `r I(hexes(c("stringr")))`

----
`str_sub()` extracts a substring between the location of two characters.

```{r str_sub1, echo = TRUE}
hopper <- "A ship in port is safe, but that's not what ships are built for."
str_sub(hopper, start = 3, end = 6)
```

You often want to use str_sub when the data is highly structured

```{r str_sub2, echo = TRUE}
phone <- "800-800-8553"
#first three
str_sub(phone, end = 3)
# last four
str_sub(phone, start = -4)

```


---
## replacing words with `str_replace()` `r I(hexes(c("stringr")))`
----
.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Hopper]
If I want to replace a specific pattern of text with another pattern,
`str_replace()` or `str_replace_all()` are very useful.

```{r str_repl1, echo = TRUE}
hopper
str_replace(hopper, "ship", "car")
str_replace_all(hopper, "ship", "car")

```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Phone Number]
Back with our phone number example, you'll see there's a difference
between `str_replace()` or `str_replace_all()`. The first only replaces
the first instance

```{r str_repl2,echo = TRUE}
phone
str_replace(phone, "800-", "")
str_replace_all(phone, "800-", "")
```

If I only want to change the *second* instance of "800-", I'll need to
use a more complicated pattern match. This would require a regular
expression

### Let's practice using stringr functions
----
Save the following string:
```{r manage_string, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
z <- "You don't manage people, you manage things.\nYou lead people."
```
- How many characters does this string have? 
- Using string subsetting by indexes, can you extract the word "people"? 
- Replace the `\n` with a space

# You keep mentioning regular expressions? 

---
# Regular Expressions 
----
-   Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are a syntax for **pattern
    matching** in strings.

-   Regex structure is used in many different computer languages

-   Wherever there is a `pattern` argument in a stringr function, you
    can use regex (to extract strings, get a logical if there is a
    match, etc...).

-   regex includes special characters, e.g., `.` and `*` These must be
    escaped using `\\` if you want to match their normal literal value.

---
# Regular Expressions  `r I(hexes(c("stringr")))`
----

-   A period "`.`" matches any character.
-   A `[:alpha:]` matches any alphabetical character.
-   You can "escape" a symbol with two backslashes "`\\.`" to match. If you don't, the asterisk in this case will be interpreted as a regular expression command, not a symbol.

By default, regular expressions will match any part of a string. It’s often useful to anchor the regular expression so that it matches from the start or end of the string. You can use:

- `^` to match the start of the string.
- `$` to match the end of the string.

```{r fruit, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
fruit <- c("Apple", "Strawberry", "Banana", "Pear", "Blackberry", "*berry")
```

## Symbols `r I(hexes(c("stringr")))`
There are a lot of regular expression character matches in R and I don't
expect you to memorize them all - I often have [the
cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/strings.pdf)
open next to me while working. Some important ones you should however be
able to recognize:

| type this: | to mean this: |
|------------|---------------|
| \\\\n                   | new line                        |
| \\\\s or \[:space:\]    | any whitespace                  |
| \\\\d or \[:digit:\]    | any digit                       |
| \\\\w or \[:alpha:\]      | any word character              |
| \[:punct:\]             | any punctuation                 |
| .                       | every character except new line |

---
## Alternates `r I(hexes(c("stringr")))`

| type this: | to mean this: |
|------------|---------------|
| [abc]      | one of a, b or c |
| [^abc]     | anything but a, b or c |

## Quantifiers `r I(hexes(c("stringr")))`

| Expression 	| matches                  	|
|------------	|--------------------------	|
| a?         	| a, zero or one times     	|
| a*         	| a, zero or more times    	|
| a+         	| a, one or more times     	|
| a\{n\}       	| a, n times               	|
| a\{n,\}      	| a, n or more times       	|

### Let's practice using stringr functions
----
Given the corpus of common words in stringr::words, use `str_view()` and create regular expressions that find all words that:

- Start with “y”
- End with “x”
- Are exactly three letters long
- Have seven letters or more
- Start with a vowel


]
```{r count3}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 3, second = 0,

                     left = 0)
```
---
# Regular Expressions `r I(hexes(c("stringr")))`

There is a lot more to learn about regular expressions what we won't cover here,
like groups and look arounds. Groups allows you to define which part of the
expression you want to extract or replace and look arounds allow you to define
what follows or precedes the expression. When you need to learn more, there are
many tools online like [https://regex101.com/](https://regex101.com/) to help
you learn. The only important thing to remember with online regular expression
tools is that `r` needs an extra `\` preceding each `\` in other coding
languages.
---
## Changing Case with stringr `r I(hexes(c("stringr")))`

-   `str_to_lower()` and `str_to_upper()` convert all letters to lower
    or capital case.
-   `str_to_sentence` converts all words and letters to sentence
    case. Includes Acronyms
-   `str_to_title` converts the first letter of every word to capital case.
    
```{r mission, echo = TRUE}
mission <- "Critical Path Institute is a catalyst in the development of new approaches to advance medical innovation and regulatory science."
str_to_lower(mission)
str_to_upper(mission)
str_to_sentence(mission)
str_to_title(mission)
```

---
## Detecting matches with stringr `r I(hexes(c("stringr")))`

`str_detect()`: Returns `TRUE` if a regex pattern matches a string and `FALSE` if it does not. Very useful for filters.

To ignore case, place a `(?i)` before the regex.
```{r str-detect, echo=TRUE}
nhanes %>% 
  select(HealthGen) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(HealthGen, "(?i)good")) %>% 
  head()
```

# Combining strings with glue `r I(hexes(c("glue")))`

age <- 50
anniversary <- as.Date("1991-10-12")

glue('My name is {name}, my age next year is {age + 1}, and my anniversary is {format(anniversary, "%A, %B %d, %Y")}.')

### Let's practice glue!
----
With the nhanes dataset, create a new character column that looks something like:
"`ID` is a `Age` year old `Gender` who `"smokes" or "doesn't smoke"`"

You'll either need to create a new variable using `ifelse()` or `case_when()` before you write your glue statement or use `ifelse()` or `case_when()` inside of `{}`

]
```{r count4}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 3, second = 0, 
                     update_every = 15,
                     left = 0)

  head()
```

`r I(hexes(c("glue", "dplyr", "pipe")))`

# What are Factors? 

---
# Factors  
----
R has a special data class, called factor, to deal with categorical data that
you may encounter when creating plots or doing statistical analyses. They are
stored as integers associated with labels and they can be ordered or unordered.
While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are actually
treated as integer vectors by R. So you need to be very careful when treating
them as strings.

To work with factors, we will practice with the `gapminder` dataset. 
```{r gapminder, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("gapminder")
library(gapminder)
```

---
# Factors 
----

Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set of values, known as
*levels*. By default, base R always sorts levels in alphabetical order. For
instance, if you have a factor with 2 levels:

```{r feeling-factor, echo = TRUE}
feeling <- factor(c("sad", "happy", "happy", "sad"))
feeling
```

R will assign `1` to the level `"happy"` and `2` to the level `"sad"`
(because `h` comes before `s` in the alphabet, even though the first element in
this vector is`"sad"`).

In R's memory, factors are represented by integers (1, 2), but are more
informative than integers because factors are self describing: `"happy"`,
`"sad"` is more descriptive than `1`, and `2`. 
---
# Factors 
----

To see the levels of a factor, we can say
```{r levels, echo=TRUE}
levels(feeling)
nlevels(feeling)
```
---
# The continent factor
----

Let's get to know the factor we'll be working with today: continent

```{r continent-factor, echo=TRUE}
glimpse(gapminder$continent)
levels(gapminder$continent)
nlevels(gapminder$continent)
class(gapminder$continent)
```

---
## reordering factors with forcats `r I(hexes(c("forcats")))`

Sometimes, the order of the factors does not matter, other times you might want
to specify the order because it is meaningful (e.g., "low", "medium", "high"),
it improves your visualization, or it is required by a particular type of
analysis. 

By default, factor levels are ordered alphabetically. Which might as well be
random, when you think about it! It is preferable to order the levels according
to some principle:

  * Frequency. Make the most common level the first and so on.
  * Another variable. Order factor levels according to a summary statistic for another variable. Example: order Gapminder countries by life expectancy.
  
---
## Manually reorder with fct_relevel `r I(hexes(c("forcats")))`

.small[Current levels]
```{r fct_relevel1, echo = TRUE}
levels(gapminder$continent) 
```

.small[Reorder by population:]
```{r fct_relevel2, echo = TRUE}
gapminder <- gapminder %>% 
  mutate(continent_reordered = fct_relevel(continent, "Asia", "Africa", 
                                           "Americas", "Europe", "Oceania"))
```

.small[New levels]
```{r fct_relevel3, echo = TRUE}
levels(gapminder$continent_reordered) 
```
---
## Automatically reorder with fct_infreq `r I(hexes(c("forcats")))`

.small[Another way to re-order your factor levels is by frequency, so the most common
factor levels come first, and the less common come later. (This is often useful
for plotting!) In this case, it is the frequency of how often each level occurs
in the variable, as seen in `fct_count(gapminder$continent)`]



```{r fct_infreq1, echo = TRUE}
# Current levels
levels(gapminder$continent)

# Reorder by frequency in dataset:
gapminder <- gapminder %>% 
  mutate(continent_infreq = fct_infreq(continent, ordered = TRUE))

# New levels
levels(gapminder$continent_infreq) 
```

## Automatically reorder based on another variable with fct_reorder `r I(hexes(c("forcats")))`
.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[fct_reorder]
What if we want to order the continent factor based on the values of another
variable? This other variable is usually quantitative and you will order the
factor according to a grouped summary. The factor is the grouping variable and
the default summarizing function is `median()` but you can specify something
else.

.panel[.panel-name[median life expectancy]
```{r fct_reorder1, echo = TRUE}
head(levels(gapminder$country))
## order countries by median life expectancy
gapminder <- gapminder %>% 
  mutate(country_med_lifexp = fct_reorder(country, lifeExp))
head(levels(gapminder$country_med_lifexp))
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[max population]
```{r fct_reorder2, echo = TRUE}
head(levels(gapminder$country))

## renaming factor levels with fct_recode `r I(hexes(c("forcats")))`

`forcats` makes easy to rename factor levels. Let's say we made a mistake and
need to recode "Oceania" to actually be "Australia". We'd use the `fct_recode` function to
do this.

```{r fct_recode1, echo = TRUE}
levels(gapminder$continent)

gapminder <- gapminder %>% 
  mutate(continent_recode = fct_recode(continent, Australia = "Oceania"))

levels(gapminder$continent_recode)
```

---
## collapsing factor levels into "other" with fct_lump `r I(hexes(c("forcats")))`

There are many other `forcat` packages for very specific uses - like making an
"other" factor for rare occurrences with `fct_lump()`. You can also use
`fct_other()` to manually set factors to equal other or `fct_collapse()` to
collapse levels into manually defined groups.

# How can I work with dates?

# Dates

If you've ever worked with dates in R before, you may know they're somewhat of a mess. Dates / times can be the `Date` class, `POSIXct` class, or `hms` class and it's all sort of confusing. That's where the lubridate package comes in.


---
## Parsing Dates Using lubridate `r I(hexes(c("lubridate")))`
----
lubridate has many "helper" functions which parse dates/times more
automatically. - The helper *function name specifies the order of the
components*: year, month, day, hours, minutes, and seconds. The help page for
`ymd` shows multiple functions to parse **dates** with different sequences of
**y**ear, **m**onth and **d**ay,

Only the order of year, month, and day matters
```{r parse-date, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(lubridate)

ymd(c("2011/01-10", "2011-01/10", "20110110"))
mdy(c("01/10/2011", "01 adsl; 10 df 2011", "January 10, 2011"))
```
---
## Parsing Times Using lubridate`r I(hexes(c("lubridate")))`
----
For times, only the order of hours, minutes, and seconds matter
```{r parse-time, echo = TRUE}
hms(c("10:40:10", "10 40 10"))
```
---
## Parsing Date-Times Using lubridate`r I(hexes(c("lubridate")))`
----
Let's parse the following date-times.

```{r parse-date-time, echo = TRUE}
t1 <- "05/26/2004 UTC 11:11:11.444" #mdy, hms
t2 <- "26 2004 05 UTC 11/11/11.444" #dym, hms

mdy_hms(t1)

## No dym_hms() function is defined, so need to use parse_datetime()
parse_date_time(t2, "d y m H M S")
```

d2 <- "2015-Mar-07"
d3 <- "06-Jun-2017"
d4 <- c("August 19 (2015)", "July 1 (2015)")
d5 <- "12/30/14 23:14:11" 
```

```{r count7}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 2, second = 30, 
                     update_every = 15,

```

# Extracting date components `r I(hexes(c("lubridate")))`

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[About]
To extract the component of a date-time, use one of the following: 
- `year()` extracts the year
- `month()` extracts the month
- `week()` extracts the week
- `mday()` extracts the day of the month (1, 2, 3, ...)
- `wday()` extracts the day of the week (Saturday, Sunday, Monday ...)
- `yday()` extracts the day of the year (1, 2, 3, ...)
- `hour()` extracts the hour
- `minute()` extract the minute
- `second()` extracts the second

## Doing Math with Time ?  `r I(hexes(c("lubridate")))`
----
Humans manipulate "clock time" with the use of policies such as [Daylight
Savings Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) which creates
irregularities in the "physical time". `lubridate` provides three classes of
time spans to facilitate math with dates and date-times.
--
- **Periods**: track changes in "clock time", and *ignore irregularities* in
    "physical time". 
--
- **Durations**: track the passage of "physical time", which deviates from
    "clock time" when irregularities occur.
--
- **Intervals**: represent specific spans of the timeline, bounded by start
    and end date-times. We won't cover this in this workshop because I find them
    to be the least useful, but you can learn more with `?interval-class`

---
## Periods`r I(hexes(c("lubridate")))`
**Periods**: track changes in "clock time", and *ignore irregularities* in "physical time".

Make a period with the name of a time unit pluralized, e.g.
```{r periods1, echo = TRUE}
p <- months(3) + days(12)
p
```

And calculate the duration between two times with basic operators:
```{r periods2, echo = TRUE}
d1 <- mdy("June 13, 2013")
d2 <- today()
d2-d1
```


---
## Durations`r I(hexes(c("lubridate")))`

**Durations**: track the passage of "physical time", which deviates from "clock time" when irregularities occur.

Durations are stored as seconds, the only time unit with a consistent length.
Add or subtract durations to model *physical processes*, like travel or
lifespan. You can create durations from years with `dyears()`, from days with
`ddays()`, etc...

```{r duration1, echo = TRUE}
dyears(1)
ddays(1)
dhours(1)
```

- Convert the start date and end date variables to be date-times.
- Create a new variable `weekday` where you extract the day of the week based on the start date (use label = TRUE option to get actual days of the week)
- Use the start date and end date variables to calculate the duration of each trip.
- Reorder the weekday factor by the median trip duration
- How much time elapsed between the start of the first trip and the end of the the last trip.]
